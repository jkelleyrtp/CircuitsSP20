From your two resistor array chips, construct an R-2R ladder network with four 2R branches. You should be able to build an R-2R ladder with two 2R branches from a single chip. Apply a voltage to the network with one channel of the SMU and measure the current flowing in each of the 2R branches in turn with the other SMU channel. Change the externally applied voltage and repeat these current measurements. Enter your measurements into MATLAB and make a semilog plot of current as a function of position for both measurements on a single graph along with appropriate theoretical expected values. Do these currents vary with position as you expect?


Next, use a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter in resistance mode to measure the resistance of your resistor. Finally, use one channel of the SMU to measure the resistor’s current–voltage characteristic. Take at least 50 points on the characteristic. Using MATLAB, fit a straight line to this curve and extract the value of the resistance from the slope of this characteristic. Make a plot showing both the measured data (as individual points) and the theoretical fit (as a solid line) along with the extracted resistance value. Compare the three values of resistance that you have obtained for this resistor. Comment on any discrepancies and suggest possible explanations for them. Which technique do you think is the most accurate? Why?
